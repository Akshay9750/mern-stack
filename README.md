## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:

  - Node.js with **Express.js** for building the server.
  - **MongoDB** for data storage (user details, movie info).
  - **JWT** for handling user authentication.
  - **bcryptjs** for password hashing.
  - **dotenv** for managing environment variables.
  - **cookie-parser** for parsing cookies (likely for sessions).

- **Frontend**:
  - **React** (assumed, since it's a Netflix clone, although not directly mentioned in the `package.json`).
  - **Axios** for making API calls to the backend.
  - **Material-UI** (if used) for UI components (optional to mention based on the actual implementation).
